          <p>Tailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework. Unlike other frameworks, like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.</p>
          <p>For example, in other traditional systems, there would be a class <code>message-warning</code> that would apply a yellow background color and bold text. To achieve this result in Tailwind, one would have to apply a set of classes created by the library: <code>bg-yellow-300</code> and <code>font-bold</code>.</p>
          <p>As of 5 August 2024, Tailwind CSS has over 81,000 stars on GitHub.</p>

            Features
          </header>
          <p>Due to the difference in basic concepts in relation to other traditional CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, it is important to know the philosophy from which Tailwind was created, as well as its basic usage.</p>

            Utility Classes
          </header>
          <p>The utility-first concept refers to the main differentiating feature of Tailwind. Instead of creating classes around components (button, panel, menu, textbox ...), classes are built around a specific style element (yellow color, bold font, very large text, center element...). Each of these classes is called utility classes.</p>
          <p>There are many utility classes in Tailwind CSS that enable to control a large number of CSS properties like colors, border, display type (display), font size and font, layout, shadow...</p>

            Variants
          </header>
          <p>Tailwind offers the possibility to apply a utility class only in some situations through media queries, which is called a variant. The main use of variants is to design a responsive interface for various screen sizes. There are also variants for the different states an element can have, such as <code>hover:</code> for when hovered, <code>focus:</code> when keyboard selected or <code>active:</code> when in use, or when the browser or operating system has dark mode enabled.</p>
          <p>Variants have two parts: the condition to be met and the class that is applied if the condition is met. For example, the variant <code>md:bg-yellow-400</code> will apply the class <code>bg-yellow-400</code> if the screen size is at least the value defined for <code>md</code></p>
          <p>Tailwind CSS is developed using JavaScript, runs via Node.js, and installs with environment package managers like npm or yarn.</p>

            Settings and Themes
          </header>
          <p>It is possible to configure the utility classes and variants that Tailwind offers through a configuration file usually named <code>tailwind.config.js</code>. In the configuration, one can set the values of the utility classes, such as the color-palette or the sizes between elements for margins.</p>
